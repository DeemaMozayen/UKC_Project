La Folie,E4 6a ***,Lead dnf,ChloeJ,"Found this absolutely nails!
The first half is quite overgrown and clearly not climbed often. I took an alternative start from Firefly due to this. From the big ledge it really steps up! It took me 4 attempts, retreating to the ledge each time, to crack the move up this first roof - leaving me pumped out of my mind.

The traverse out left to the obvious incut hold was ok but from there on I was greeted with a horrendous looking mantel on non-existent holds! 

At this point, I was thoroughly broken and exhausted and chose to lower off the gear, retrieving it via abseil.",29/Jul/23,Wintour's Leap,Trad,British,England
Firefly,E3 5c ***,Lead O/S,ChloeJ,"Perhaps not a true O/S as had seconded the E1 before. The harder independent climbing after the ledge was very good, with equally good (too much so?) fixed protection. Almost felt like a sport climb in places…🤨",29/Jul/23,Wintour's Leap,Trad,British,England

Centurion,HVS 5a ***,2nd dnf,ChloeJ,Bailed after P1 because we were utterly exhausted and it was really cold. ,21/Jul/23,Ben Nevis,Trad,British,Scotland
Freak Out,E4 6a ***,Lead O/S,ChloeJ,"Thought I was going to come off about 4 times on this. Got very pumped working out the crux roof and had very little left in the tank for the remaining 15m or so. Had also used all the right gear by this point. It then turned out that the crack above was mostly wet. Had the fight of my life and narrowly clawed my way to the top - having used up all my chalk, psych, energy and bravado. Needed to lie down for a long time afterwards!",20/Jul/23,Aonach Dubh,Trad,British,Scotland

Cuillin Ridge Traverse (Summer),VD  ***,AltLd O/S,ChloeJ,"Lifetime tick - this is a BIG day out! Took us 20hrs from camp to hotel and was potentially the most physically exhausting thing I have ever done. We suffered a lot from the heat & dehydration and it took a lot of willpower to keep going. You have to keep it together on near-constant scrambling and exposed climbing over ~10km. We ended up completely bypassing Sgurr Alisdair and Am Basteir due to time pressure, and with the latter - sheer exhaustion.",15/Jun/23,Cuillin Ridge (Traverse),Trad,British,Scotland

Whipped off going up from the undercut and pinch at the end of the traverse, when the holds suddenly get smaller.  I then had to prusik back up to my high point and climb to the top. I was then informed that no-one wanted to second me so I had to conduct 2 separate abseils and jug up the rope as many times, to get the gear back.
4 hours later from when I set off, I stumbled back to the car-park - defeated and badly in need of a rest day.",27/May/23,Stennis Head,Trad,British,Wales

Whose Line is it Anyway?,7a+  ***,Lead RP,DavidMcK,"Pretty cool route. 3rd go. Lowered from 3/4 height on 1st go, putting clips in as far as my elbows could bear. Worked the higher crux and put the remaining clips in on 2nd go. Rested and then finally went for the redpoint. This was close, even with the mid-height kneebar. Found myself desperately snatching and catching the finishing jug, despite that I was probably falling off as I did so. Great to push a bit harder after the initial post-lockdown shock. Joy slightly tempered by achey elbows once down.
